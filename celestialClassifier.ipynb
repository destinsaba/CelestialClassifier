    "In this machine learning project for ENSF 611, we will analyze the Stellar Classification Dataset from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This dataset, available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17/data), contains information about various celestial objects, including stars, galaxies, and quasars. Our goal is to build a model that can accurately classify these objects based on their features. This project will involve data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation."
